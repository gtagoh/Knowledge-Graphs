        "Graph retrieval-augmented generation (Graph RAG) is emerging as a powerful enhancement to traditional vector search methods in RAG-based applications. By combining the power of graph databases and vector-based approaches, you can achieve more accurate, context-rich results.\n",
        "\n",
        "Graph databases store data as nodes and relationships, representing complex and interconnected information in a structured way. This makes them highly effective for capturing intricate relationships and attributes across diverse data types. On the other hand, vector databases excel at managing unstructured data by converting it into high-dimensional vectors, making it easier to search for semantic similarities. Integrating these two approaches allows RAG applications to leverage the strengths of both graph and vector databases, which we demonstrate in this tutorial."
